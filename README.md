# Mobile-Calculator
A simple mobile scientific calculator created with React Native and Expo. Some functions are not yet implemented. The production of this app is still in progress.

## Features
- Use mathjs to handle math data types and calculations.
- Simulate the behaviour of a typical Casio calculator (Casio fx-50FHII).

## Use
This program is developed with Expo and tested with its metro bundler, but not published as an app, so it is expected to be opened with Expo and an Android emulator.

## To-do Features
- Calculation history
- More constants
- Improvements on GUI
- Program: allow users to define functions themselves
